need a resnet101-5d3b4d8f.pth, may get it from pytorch's official website.

make a filefolder named models, and put resnet101-5d3b4d8f.pth in it, then make a filefolder named train.

the filefloder looks like this:

./models/train
./models/resnet101-5d3b4d8f.pth

after train, your trained model will stay in ./models/train, then use predict.py to get the result picture.
